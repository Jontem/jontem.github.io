The Big O notation is a simplified method for describing an algorithms effiency. 

## Constant time O(1)
An algorithm that isn't dependenant on the size of the input executes at instant time. In Big O notation this is written as `O(1)` and pronounced as `Big O of one`

## Logarithmic time O(log n)

## Linear time O(N)

## Exponential time O(N^2)


* Doesn't care about the computers performance
* Largest win
* Constants removed when higher complexity exists
* O(1) Constant time
* O(log n) logarithmic time
* O(N) Linear time
* O(N^2) exponential time
